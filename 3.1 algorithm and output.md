3.1 Total Weight of Widgets and Gizmos

Scenario: An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then compute and display the total weight.

Algorithm:

1. Input number of widgets from the user.

2. Input number of gizmos from the user.

3. Set widget weight = 75 grams.

4. Set gizmo weight = 112 grams.

5. Calculate total weight = (no. of widgets * 75) + (no. of gizmos * 112).

6. Display total weight with a message.

Code:
widgets = int(input("Enter the number of widgets: "))
gizmos = int(input("Enter the number of gizmos: "))
WIDGET_WEIGHT = 75
GIZMOS_WEIGHT = 112
total_weight = (widgets * WIDGET_WEIGHT) + (gizmos * GIZMOS_WEIGHT)
print("The total weight of all these widgets and gizmos is", total_weight, "grams.")

Output:
Enter the number of widgets: 10
Enter the number of gizmos: 20
The total weight of all these widgets and gizmos is 2990 grams.
