3.5 Print Pattern Based on Input Size

Scenario: Write a Python program to print the following pattern based on input size.

Algorithm:

1. Input an integer n (number of rows).

2. Initialize counter num = 1 to track the current number to print.

3. Loop from i = 1 to n (each row):
   • Print spaces: (n - i) spaces to align the row.
   • Loop from j = 1 to i:
     - Print num and increment it.
   • Move to the next line.

Code:
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
num = 1
for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(" " * (n - i), end="")
    for j in range(i):
        print(num, end=" ")
        num += 1
    print()

Output:
Input: 3
1
2 3
4 5 6
Input: 4
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
