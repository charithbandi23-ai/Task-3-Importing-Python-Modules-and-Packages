3.3 Leap Year Check


Scenario: Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

Algorithm:

1. Input a year from the user.

2. Check if the year is divisible by 400. If yes, it is a leap year.

3. Otherwise, check if the year is divisible by 100. If yes, it is not a leap year.

4. Otherwise, check if the year is divisible by 4. If yes, it is a leap year.

5. If none of the above, it is not a leap year.

6. Display the result with the year.

Code:
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if year % 400 == 0:
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
elif year % 100 == 0:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
elif year % 4 == 0:
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
